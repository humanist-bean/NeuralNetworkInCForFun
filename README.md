# NeuralNetworkInCForFun
Since my software developing job fell through this summer I've had a bit of time on my hands. I'm bored and I miss programming so I'm going to try and build a neural network from scratch in C. I think I might restrict myself to wikipedia, the original C book, and the online Neural Networks and Deep Learning book for guidance. IT'S SEGFAULT TIME!!! (⌐■_■)
